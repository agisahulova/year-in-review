# YEAR-IN-REVIEW
This year was and still is very important for me. Many things have happened. I am moving on with my life. So let's take a look at what's happened.


## SCHOOL
Officially, this is my last year as a student. It's a strange feeling. I've always dreaded big exams, and the closer it got, the more stressed I got. But I know I can't do anything. I just have to let it go, and I know I can do it. I've always been terrified of the idea of writing my bachelor's thesis. I didn't know how to start, and let's see. It's already turned in. Wow. I think of this year as preparation for adult life.  English in particular has taught me to be more communicative and not dread having to speak English. I've started to enjoy it.

## WORK
I had a part-time job at school delivering food as a courier. Now it's time to move on and pursue my dreams. I'm currently waiting for the second round of the selection process to come around, as I'm applying for the position of Security Control Officer. I'm nervous but excited at the same time. I hope it all works out and my dream comes true.

## LIFE
A lot of things have happened in my personal life as well. Not only am I developing, but I'm also pushing forward relationships with loved ones. Also, a new member has joined our family. We had a kitten meowing under our house in the winter. Frozen and hungry. We couldn't find an owner, so we got a beautiful cat named Míňa. 
I have also visited many places, like Kos, Paris and Lisbon. These are unforgettable experiences. I believe there will be more to come.
